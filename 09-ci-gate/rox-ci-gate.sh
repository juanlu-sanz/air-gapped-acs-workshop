# rox-ci-gate.sh
# Purpose: CI-agnostic RHACS security gate. Needs only bash and curl, so it runs in any
# CI/CD system, in any container-based runner, or in a local shell.
#
# Required environment:
#   ROX_ENDPOINT      Central address as host:port, e.g. central-stackrox.apps.example.com:443
#   ROX_API_TOKEN     API token with the "Continuous Integration" role (store as a masked CI secret)
#   IMAGE             Image to evaluate, ideally by digest (registry/repo@sha256:...)
# Optional:
#   MANIFESTS         Space-separated list of Kubernetes manifests to check against deploy-time policies
#   ROX_CLUSTER       Cluster name used as context for "roxctl deployment check" (4.11+)
#   REPORT_DIR        Where reports are written (default: ./rhacs-reports)
#   ROX_TLS_FLAG      Set to "--insecure-skip-tls-verify" only for labs with self-signed Central certs
#
# Exit code: 0 = gate passed; non-zero = an enforced BUILD or DEPLOY policy was violated
# (or roxctl could not reach Central). The CI job should fail on non-zero.
